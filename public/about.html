      <p>
        CBRNe Response CANADA is a service-oriented consultative group of companies dedicated to
        developing efficient, environmentally conscious, and economically viable alternatives and expertise to
        rigorously respond to environmental disasters. Using existing infrastructure, we eliminate the need for time
        consuming sourcing because we focus our efforts on solutions for our clients directly, covering all aspects
        of Occupational Safety, Security, Hazardous Environmental Response, Spill Control Compliance
        and Remediation. We intend to make enough profit to generate a fair return and to finance continued
        growth through revenue on Fee-Based Training Programs through which will facilitate Equipment Supply,
        Service & Maintenance Contracts complete with ongoing follow up customer support to ensure programs
        are both well understood, projects are successfully implemented and equipment is commissioned to the
        satisfaction of our clients.

      <h1>- ABOUT -</h1>
      <h5>- ABOUT -</h5>
      <p>
        CBRNe Response CANADA started in 2008 and developed into an established operation in late
        2017 to bring together an international global network spanning all continents with primary focus
        on China, Africa and the Middle Eastern countries with support for North and South America
        plus Australasia. We deliberately concentrate our efforts on occupational safety, security and
        hazardous environmental response, spill control compliance and remediation. We offer expertise
        through our professional network developed over 30 years to bridge the gap in areas for CBRNe
        such as Chemical, Biological. Radiological, Nuclear and Environmental.
      </p>
      <p>
        At CBRNe Response CANADA, we have developed a comprehensive business model which
        represents wide scopes of interest. Our efforts cover both supply and procurement to support a
        distribution/end-user network in most areas for equipment, consultation, training and product
        sourcing assistance to ensure a project not only gets off the ground but is completed to the
        satisfaction of the end-users and/or organizations involved within any given project. Our
        global procurement, distribution and consultative network brings various disciplines together so that
        project leaders and facilitators may enjoy the convenience of a single source provider similar to that
        of a technical professional general contractor. We pride ourselves on being thorough and
        fearless in finding solutions to problems which plague many projects and ultimately derail
        their success in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our strengths lie in supplying appropriate equipment and services plus thorough onsite or
        web-based training for the personal safety of people whom help fight to protect our global
        environment for our future generations. We can provide an all-inclusive source for solutions
        which will enable government organizations and commercial business to operate safely,
        efficiently and keep within the confines of safe hazardous environmental compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our executive level professional network supports emergency service providers, military,
        medical, biotech, pharma/chemical, MRO for the transportation industries and the oil and
        gas energy sectors. Our attempt is to leave no stone unturned so that workers return home safely
        and our environment maintains its majestic influence on our familiesâ€™ lives for years to come.
